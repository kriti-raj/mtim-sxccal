							Modern Trends in Microbiology is the flagship event of the Department of Microbiology, St
							Xavier's College Autonomous, Kolkata. This acclaimed international seminar was
							conceptualised by
							our Convenor, Dr. Arup Kr. Mitra and executed by the entire department, every year since the
							last two decades. Over the years we have had the pleasure of attending informative sessions
							delivered by several exceptional speakers from different institutes, in and outside Kolkata.
							This has reinforced our belief in interdepartmental relationships. As we step into the 20th
							year
							of this educational extravaganza, we invite all the colleges across Kolkata to join us in
							this
							illuminative journey of learning through events like Paper Presentation, Poster
							Presentations
							and several others to be hosted in our College Campus on 6th and 7th of October, 2023

							Paper Presentation "No research without action, No action without research" The true purpose
							of
							any scientific study, lies in the art of proving and disproving theories through practical
							application. So we bring to you, the meticulous art of Paper Presentation. It's an exclusive
							event for the students of St.Xavier's College, Autonomous Kolkata. Participants will be
							writing
							as well as presenting research papers adhering to the topic Discovery, Novelty and
							Aspirations
							in the field of microbiology. Both original as well as review papers are welcome.

							Poster Presentation “Research is seeing what everybody else has seen and thinking what
							nobody
							else has thought." The art of Poster Presentation helps to visually depict the scientific
							approach on almost any and every theme. Participants will present a poster designed
							originally
							by them adhering to the topic Discovery, Novelty and Aspirations in the field of
							microbiology.

							Quiz To be or not to be might be the question, but for this quiz, the questions will ring
							and
							revolve around your love for Biology. A classic Quiz with three rounds where 8 teams will
							fight
							it out till one remains in the end, proving again Darwin's laws of Natural Selection.

							Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still. With
							this philosophy in mind we present to you our new event for this year. Participants will be
							submitting pictures on the topic that will be declared a week before the registration dates.
							The
							theme remains broadly Biology They will be judged on the uniqueness of the picture,
							adherence to
							theme and relevance to the topic.

								I, the Convener of Modern Trends In Microbiology, is really proud of the fact that
								this
								event of the Department of Microbiology, St. Xavier’s College(Autonomous), Kolkata
								has
								become a testament to the fact that diligence reaps the sweet fruits of success. In
								the
								20th year since its inception MTIM; the representative of the department, has proved
								its
								mettle. The immense enthusiasm of my fellow students and persistent efforts of my
								fellow
								colleagues and support staff makes the event a greater success each passing year. To
								commemorate the
								20th year we have also planned for an alumni outreach through a dinner reception, to
								celebrate and revisit the
								cherished memories together. This two-day seminar is aimed to inculcate scientific
								thinking in
								students and help them strive for excellence. The journey from inter-departmental
								event
								to a national seminar
								has been an arduous yet fulfilling one, two decades worth of experience and memories
								aims us to
								reach for greater heights. I would also like to thank Father Principal, Vice
								Principal,
								respected
								Dean of Arts and Science for allowing us to organize this event. The zeal that I
								witness
								amidst the
								corridors of the department makes me sure, we have created a legacy and it will live
								on.
								<br><br>
								Wishing all the best and a successful MTIM XX,
								<strong>Dr. Arup Kumar Mitra</strong>
